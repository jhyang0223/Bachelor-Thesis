# SUB-1GHz Wireless Internet Extender for Providing Wireless LAN Services in Outdoor Working Environments
## abstract
In outdoor work environments where wired LAN access is not possible within a 100m radius, such as rural rice paddies, fields, and construction sites, access to the Internet should be made using expensive data from Eggs or smartphone LTE. Alternatively, a WiFi extender in the 2.4 GHz band should be used, but due to the feature of the frequency, the operating distance is short due to low diffraction. This paper proposes an Internet relay function using an RF module in the 900 MHz band with a radius of 1 km. **We implemented a TI CC1310 Device Driver based on 1:1 TDD Communication and a Linux Network Device Driver based on SPI Communication with CC1310 that includes Packet's segmentation & assembly function and Flow Control function.** This makes it easier to work in a better environment by establishing an Internet use environment for those working in rural rice paddies, fields, and construction sites with a shorter operating distance than WiFi extenders that complements indoor shaded areas.
